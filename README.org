#+TITLE: Magemacs

[[file:sources/intro.png]]

* What is the title about?
  What at first was a pun with my name (Magueta + Emacs) later
  developed to the philosophy of the entire customization behind
  it. Make things work like magic, but make it easy for people to
  replicate your tricks.
  
* Philosophy & What does it have?
  Giving magic support to F# out of the box. Linting, auto completion,
  F# interactive with history, compilation, etc were all a hassle to
  configure, so feel free to grab the files.

  This project also has modifications on the interface, keybindings
  and adds magit, SQL RDBMS, nix-mode, OCaml, Common Lisp, Clojure, C,
  theme management and more.
